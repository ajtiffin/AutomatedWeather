The main SACU trade‑related story this week is renewed, high‑profile debate in South Africa about reforming (or ultimately even exiting) SACU to gain greater flexibility for bilateral trade deals, triggered by concerns that the customs union constrains South Africa’s trade policy and is being undermined by growing intra‑SACU protectionism.  In parallel, there are technical but noteworthy moves on SACU‑wide customs/tariff administration, including draft South African customs schedule changes affecting SACU tariff lines, and an ongoing sunset review of anti‑dumping duties relevant to the SACU market.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

## Push for SACU reform and trade flexibility

- Commentary by Wandile Sihlobo argues that SACU appears **opaque** and unpredictable to many potential partners, who are primarily interested in South Africa rather than the wider region.[2][3][1]
- The pieces contend that South Africa’s need to consult Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia on trade deals slows negotiations and can deter or delay agreements at a time when South Africa faces pressures in key markets such as the United States and seeks faster export‑market diversification.[3][6][1][2]
- The proposed “modern” approach would allow SACU members to retain low internal tariffs but negotiate bilateral trade agreements individually, giving South Africa more agility while trying to preserve regional development support mechanisms.[6][1][2][3]

## Intra‑SACU protectionism and non‑tariff barriers

- The same commentary highlights recurring import bans on South African vegetables by Botswana and Namibia as an example where members “do not follow the rules,” creating non‑tariff barriers inside a customs union that is supposed to guarantee free movement of goods.[2][3]
- These measures are framed domestically as food‑security and farmer‑protection tools, but are characterised in the articles as protectionist when imposed without any animal or plant health risk, and thus contrary to the spirit of SACU.[3][2]
- This intra‑SACU friction is presented as a key factor behind growing questions in South Africa about whether remaining in the current SACU arrangement is in its best trade interest, a debate that is expected to intensify through 2026.[7][6][3]

## Revenue‑sharing and development finance angle

- Commentators emphasise that South Africa’s fiscal transfers to partners via SACU’s revenue‑sharing formula amount to significant, often “unrecognised generosity,” effectively providing regional development finance through customs revenue.[1][2][3]
- The suggested reform path would gradually shift from the existing revenue‑sharing model toward a more explicit development‑finance mechanism, with greater participation from multilateral development institutions and other partners, to avoid destabilising SACU members that depend heavily on these flows.[1][2][3]
- The political economy message is that South Africa should prioritise its own trade interests while carefully managing adjustment costs for neighbours, given the potential regional spillovers from any abrupt SACU changes.[2][3][1]

## Technical trade administration and tariff issues

- South Africa’s revenue authority (SARS) circulated draft amendments to customs schedules effective 1 January 2026, including creation of a new 8‑digit tariff subheading 7019.80.30 for glass wool under heading 7019.80, intended to improve monitoring of mineral‑wool imports in the SACU market.[5]
- Trade law updates also flagged a sunset review of anti‑dumping duties on stranded wire, with public comments due in early January 2026, a process that matters for producers and importers supplying or sourcing within SACU.[4]
- These changes, while technical, form part of the ongoing fine‑tuning of SACU’s common external tariff and trade‑remedy regime administered via South African institutions on behalf of the union.[8][4][5]

## Framing within broader trade policy debate

- A separate policy note on South Africa’s inclusive growth agenda reiterates the call to “review SACU,” arguing again that the customs union can deter deeper bilateral engagement with South Africa and that current, slower SACU‑wide processes are misaligned with the urgency of South Africa’s trade‑expansion needs.[9][6]
- The core narrative across these pieces is that, as global trade conditions become more volatile and competitive, South Africa requires greater speed and autonomy in negotiating market access, while SACU partners prioritise stability and continued fiscal support from the existing arrangement.[6][3][1][2]
- This week’s discourse thus centres less on new signed agreements and more on whether SACU’s institutional design is fit for purpose for the next phase of South Africa‑led regional and global trade integration.[7][3][1][2]
